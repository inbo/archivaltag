The goal of archivaltag is to provide information to read archival tag
data. Such data are stored differently depending on the manufacturer and
the model. Also, the data are different depending on the sensors built
in.

## Installation

You can install the development version of archivaltag from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("inbo/archivaltag")
```

However, as reading R functions will be not developed at this stage, no
real installation is needed. Check the vignette online for more
information about reading data files of archival tags.
